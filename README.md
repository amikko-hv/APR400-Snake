# APR400-Snake

The project contains a class library with started code for a game of [Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)).

The code is accompanied by a test project for unit test written with xUnit.

The purpose of this code is to practice in thinking about problems in terms of data structures and algorithms.
You may use existing collections provided by .NET or implement your own custom data structures.

Focus on the logic for the Snake game's implementation and how to represent them in terms of data structures and algorithms.

A real game would need graphics rendering, input handling, audio and so on. Please ignore these aspects for now.

Think about how your implementation performs in terms of Big O notation.
